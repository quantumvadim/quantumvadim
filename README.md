## 📚 Projects

- **💉 Lifeline Informatics**  
  Using Quantum AI for multi-vector pattern analysis across complex data ecosystems.  
  - PauliZ Expectations  
  - PyTorch Integration  
  - Loss: CrossEntropy, Optimizer: Adam  
  By facilitating semi-auto-focused patient to patieent communications we are working to improving quality of life for cancer survivors and to identify actionable suiside prevention information to save lives. Inititate contact directly when suicide pattern is identified instead of giving out phone numbers and websites. Actionable intelligence drives preventive actions instead of after-effect responses.
