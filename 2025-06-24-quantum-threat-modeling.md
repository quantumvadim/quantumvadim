Quantum computing is a neccessary way of thinking. Today. 

No matter how popullar, vast, and cutting age, LLMs of today only learn one dimension at a time. They operate in a singular space, one universe at a time if you will. Quantum AI operates in a multiverse.  Classical AI models generate rich outputs (logits, embeddings, etc.) that may appear random, but, complex relationships in these outputs may not be fully captured or available. Quantum AI hybrid integration provides tools for higher-dimensional, entangled pattern recognition to prove or disprove randomness of the events. 

Stay tuned for risk and threat models with mitigation blueprints.
